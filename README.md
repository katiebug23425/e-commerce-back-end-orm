## Description:
A back-end database for an e-commerce store that allows the user to create a development database, seed it with test data, sync models with Sequelize and MySQL. User has the capability to use the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes to show and alter data in the database. 


## Usage:

Create a .env file using the example file provided and enter your user name and password for MySQL. Log into MySQL and source the schema.sql file. Quit MySQL. In the terminal invoke the "npm run seed" script command to seed the database. Next enter the "npm run watch nodemon" command to initiate the server. Open Insomnia (recommended route testing app) and you will be able to GET (see all), PUT (update), POST (create), or DELETE products, tags and categories as desired.
